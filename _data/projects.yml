- title: Dynamic Product Lists Generator
  term: 2021
  description: |-
    Development of a recommendation engine that is capable of generating and recommending dynamic productlists for the newly onboarded Sysco customers. 
    This benefits Sysco as new customers get immediate exposureto Sysco's products that are relevant to their business type/activities from the recommended lists and the existing customers get the opportunity to try out new products in Sysco's product catalogue rather than purchasing products in static order templates.
    Recommendations are based on multiple feature parameters such as customers' cuisine types, location, etc.
    Clustering of customers was performed utilising the K-means clustering algorithm.
